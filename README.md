# round-robin-wasm
Round robin algorithm implemented with WASM using TinyGo compiler

### Web Assembly Demo

In order to test the performance of WebAssembly, we implemented a round robin scheduling algorithm for 6000 players. We have the same algorithm implemented in VanillaJS and Typescript, which will be compiled with AssemblyScript to WebAssembly.
